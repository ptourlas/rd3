# rd3
A minimal integration between React.js and D3.js.

The scope of this repository is to provide a backbone for 
showing a graph.
Interactivity is currently limited since it shouldn't be seen as polished application but as a playground that demonstrates basic techniques for rather fundamental issues
while developing a UI around a graph.

This example uses a dataset that forms a 
[Petersen graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph).
Also note how the constraints applied during the simulation 
force the graph to be of [unit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_distance_graph).
